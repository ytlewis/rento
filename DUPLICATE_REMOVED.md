# ✅ Duplicate Section Removed

## What Was Removed

The old "Tenants & Bookings" table section has been removed from the Admin Dashboard.

### Before:
- Had TWO sections showing tenant/booking information:
  1. Old "Tenants & Bookings" table (basic, showing IDs)
  2. New "Tenant Management" + "Booking Monitor" components (detailed, with actions)

### After:
- Only ONE set of components for tenant/booking management:
  - ✅ **Tenant Management** - Comprehensive tenant info with actions
  - ✅ **Booking Monitor** - Detailed booking tracking with status management

## Current Admin Dashboard Sections

1. **Stats** - Overview metrics
2. **Booking Approvals** - Approve/reject pending bookings
3. **Admin Payment Accounts** - Manage payment accounts
4. **Tenant Management** - View and manage all tenants
5. **Booking Monitor** - Track all bookings with detailed info
6. **Admin Management** - Manage admin users
7. **Apartments Management** - Add/edit/delete properties
8. **Payments** - View payment history

## Why This Is Better

The newer components (Tenant Management & Booking Monitor) provide:
- ✅ More detailed information
- ✅ Better UI/UX
- ✅ Action buttons (cancel bookings, etc.)
- ✅ Status badges with colors
- ✅ Tenant names instead of just IDs
- ✅ Apartment names instead of just IDs
- ✅ Better organization

The old table was redundant and less functional.
